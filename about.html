                    <h3>How it started?</h3>
                    <p>As we all know 2020 was a year the world was striving to survive<br>
                        the global pandemic of covid-19. During these dire times we felt an<br>
                        urge to make an impact with whatever we had; and so we tried!! We<br>
                        tried to uplift the underprivileged and help the needy with all our<br>
                        resources and material we could arrange, it was tough but we didn't<br>
                        lose our hope and kept going in order to bring a change everyone<br>
                        was expecting the bigger authorities to bring in the societies on<br>
                        smaller levels. We started off as a group of bunch of highschoolers<br>
                        but now are a team of numerous people from different parts of the<br>
                        city and state! 28th March 2021, the day we officially landed on the<br>
                        ground to serve our duties as the youth of the most rapidly<br>
                        progressing nation afterall, the main hope of a nation lies in the<br>
                        arms of its youth.</p>

             <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Nayepankh?</h1>
             <p>Nayepankh foundation was initiated to bring a change and help people during the tough times of Covid. Later in the year, the NGO started to expand their operations<br>
                and provide help to a wider section of the society. With this revamped vision, the NGO acquired the name of NayePankh - giving wings to uplift the underprivileged<br>
                section of our society. NayePankh is one of the eminent NGOs espoused in providing food, sanitary napkins, clothes, educating underprivileged sectors of our<br>
                society for the better future. We make efforts to solve daily problems faced by people of India. Most of the young women feel humiliating in public places during<br>
                their menstrual cycle; to bring change we create awareness campaigns among woman and youths about personal hygiene, providing sanitary napkins. Also, in our<br>
                endeavour to fight hunger we distribute food not only to the underprivileged community but also to the stray animals. We are also providing clothes to the poor<br>
                families. Till date we have helped more than two lakhs of people. Although this seems quite a big achievement, but our goal is still not complete, therefore we're<br>
                continuing more with hustle. When lockdown was hitting hard, we took a decision and now we are a 124 and 80G certified NGO (that means if someone donates to<br>
                NayePankh they will get a relief of 50%in income tax). The most striking feature about us is that we are completely led by the youths of our country, many of whom<br>
                are still in their colleges and schools. We are on a mission to make this earth a better place to live for all creatures. We are here as BADALTE BHARAT KI NAYI<br>
